# inspector
Inspector is a data visualization dashboard. It supports the visualization of
* Config files
* Metadata: Network Analyzer layer and Model layer
* Simulation results: singlewarehouse, TraditionalSupplyChain, Simulator
* Forecast: demand, orders

## Example command
```bash
python main.py
```
* When you use Inspector to check the Metadata (Network Analyzer layer and Model layer), it takes time to load data from the Cloud Storage. Please be patient of it.
